SUMMARY:NoPo Labor Day/Birthday Camping
LOCATION:Ramona Falls Trailhead
URL:https://www.facebook.com/events/381457332721494/
DESCRIPTION:Hello all. I am very excited to in
 vite you all to the second year of
  what we hope to be a tradition. L
 ast year we scooped out some amazi
 ng dispersed sites off Muddy Fork 
 rd\, on the way to Romona Falls. Th
 e site is massive and hidden from 
 the road which also includes 3 sat
 ellite siteS so there is plenty of
  room for everyone. \n\nLuke and mys
 elf with arrive Thursday to secure
  the sites. We expect people to co
 me and go throughout the weekend. 
 We only ask that you arrive before
  sunset to setup camp and so one o
 f us won‚Äôt have to wait up for y
 ou as the trail can be hard to see
  in low light. No worries though a
 s it is only 200 yards off the roa
 d. Come join us and head off on yo
 ur own adventure. Romona Falls\, PC
 T\, and Timberline trail all connec
 t just up past the site. This is a
 n open event and I would like you 
 to extend invites to folks you thi
 nk may enjoy some time away from t
 he city\, or maybe a friend visitin
 g for the weekend. All are welcome
 . \n\nThings to note: This is disper
 sed camping so no toilets or showe
 rs are available. If this is an is
 sue there are campsites just up th
 e road\, 2 minute drive\, with outho
 uses available. There will likely 
 be a burn ban so plan your meals a
 ccording but we will likely have s
 ome apparatus for cooking. It can 
 get chilly at night so bring a cha
 nge of close. We found a great gro
 ve where we can fit many hammocks\,
  5 last year\, so bring them if you
  got them. Also\, byob as I am not 
 sure I can supply everyone\, and my
 self\, for 5 days.\n\nWe will have mo
 re details as the event gets close
 r. If you have any questions pleas
 e feel free to post them in the fe
 ed. Hope to see you all there.  \n\n
